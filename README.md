# Deprecation notice
A new project [go-winapi-gen](https://github.com/zzl/go-winapi-gen) that supports both Win32 and WinRT API is available now, so this project will no longer be maintained.

# go-win32api-gen

Generated Win32 API bindings for Golang from win32metadata.

Note that this tool do not parse winmd file directly, but parse the json files generated by
[win32jsongen](https://github.com/marlersoft/win32jsongen). Thanks to @marler8997 for making our life easier.
